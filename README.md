Diabetes Risk Prediction Study
This project addresses the pressing issue of diabetes prevalence in the United States, aiming to predict distinct risk categories using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset. The dataset, comprising 50,000 survey responses. The objective is to develop a predictive model that effectively classifies individuals into three categories: 0 for no diabetes/only during pregnancy, 1 for prediabetes, and 2 for diabetes.

This is done by building a machine learning model to predict the Diabetes_012 factor.
